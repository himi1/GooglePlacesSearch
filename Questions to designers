Come up with a few questions to ask about the design of the app you're creating.
The audience is designers.

- Would you want to display certain details of the autocomplete results apart from the name on the search page?, say, "address" of Establishments.
- Is the app user experience friendly?
- What do you think can be done to enhance d details page further
- What features you think are missing from this implementation?
