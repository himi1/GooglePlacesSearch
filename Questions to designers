Come up with a few questions to ask about the design of the app you're creating.
The audience is designers.

- Would you want to display certain details of the autocomplete results apart from the name on the search page?, say, "address" of Establishments.
- I think my details page looks pretty crappy in design, what would you suggest to make it look better?
